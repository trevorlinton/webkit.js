NAME

git-upstream-diff -

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git upstream-diff' [--wordwise] [<extra args for git-diff>*]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Shows a diff beween your current branch and it's upstream. This is 'roughly' the
same as:

----
git diff --patience -C -C HEAD@{upstream}  <1> <2>
----
<1> `-C -C` detects file copies/renames
<2> `--patience` uses the patience-diff algorithm, which tends to produce nicer
  diffs in many cases.

The difference is that `HEAD@{upstream}` is actually the tagged merge base of
your branch (See linkgit:git-rebase-update[1]). This means that if your upstream
branch was rebased, but you haven't yet rebased the current branch on top of it,
you'll still see an accurate diff compared to just diffing against
`@{upstream}`.

The `--wordwise` option also allows `git-diff` to do word-by-word comparison
in a semi-intelligent way. However, sometimes it can produce surprising results,
so it is disabled by default.


OPTIONS
-------

--wordwise::
  Print a colorized word-wise diff instead of a line-wise diff.

<extra args for git-diff>::
  Extra arguments are included in the invocation of linkgit:git-diff[1]. These
  can be anything that `git-diff` normally takes.
+
--
`--stat`;;
  This is particularly useful to show 'which' files have been changed in
  comparison to the upstream branch.
`-- <filename patterns>*`;;
  Restrict the diff to only show the diff for given files compared to the
  upstream.
--


CONFIGURATION VARIABLES
-----------------------

depot-tools.upstream-diff.default-args
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A list-configuration variable. Each instance of this config variable will be
prepended to all invocations of `git upstream-diff`, as if you had passed them
on the command line.
